# fitgirl_magnet_scraper
simple crude bash script that collects the primary magnet links for all of fitgirls torrents and places them in a .txt document

needs to be ran as admin 

once the script is done it will create a folder located in the same directory as this script called "final_product"
inside that folder will be a document called "filtered_magnets.txt" containg all the magnet links 

the contents of "filtered_magnets.txt" can be copyed and pasted into your torrent client or you can configure your client to read from 
/(dir where script is located)/final_product/filtered_magnets.txt

the script takes a while to complete and throws minor errors but works.
