# fitgirl_magnet_scraper
crude bash script that collects the first magnet link for all of fitgirls torrents and places them in a .txt document

needs to be ran with admin privlages 


1. create a folder located in the same directory as this script called "final_product"
2. inside that folder it wll create a document called "filtered_magnets.txt" containg all the magnet links 
3. run a clean up job to remove all the guff 

the contents of "filtered_magnets.txt" can be copyed and pasted into your torrent client or you can configure your client to read from 
/(dir where script is located)/final_product/filtered_magnets.txt

the script takes a long time to complete and throws minor errors but works.
